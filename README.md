# Ashish Gogula

Software & Design Engineer

I help people turn ideas into real products. Tools and AI can speed things up, but they can’t replace taste, judgment, or the care that goes into building something meaningful. I love shaping interfaces, solving problems, and growing alongside others who value craft as much as I do.

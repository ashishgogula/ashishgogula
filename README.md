## 🎯 What I Do

I'm a **Software & Design Engineer** based in Hyderabad, and I love the sweet spot where beautiful design meets solid engineering. I solve problems, improve user experiences, and ship features that move the needle.

### My Approach
- **User-First Thinking:** Every technical decision starts with "Will this make life easier for our users?"
- **Business Impact:** I connect the dots between code and business goals
- **Team Collaboration:** I work best when bouncing ideas off designers, product folks, and fellow engineers
- **Practical Solutions:** Clean, maintainable code that other developers will thank you for

## 🛠️ What's in My Toolkit

**Frontend Magic**  
React • Next.js • Angular • TypeScript • Redux • Tailwind • Framer Motion

**Backend & Infrastructure**  
Java • Spring Boot • Node.js • REST APIs • MySQL • Redis • AWS • Docker

**Design & User Experience**  
Figma • Responsive Design • Component Libraries • Accessibility Standards

**The Essentials**  
Git • CI/CD • Security (JWT, OAuth, Okta) • Performance Optimization • Testing

## 💼 The Kind of Work I Love

**Building Products From Scratch**  
There's something special about taking an idea from whiteboard to production. I build full-stack applications that handle everything from user authentication to real-time data processing.

**Making Things Better**  
Whether it's refactoring legacy code, improving load times, or redesigning a confusing interface, I get excited about incremental improvements that compound over time.

**Bridging Gaps**  
I speak both "developer" and "human." This helps me translate technical constraints into business decisions and user needs into technical requirements.

## 🌱 Right Now, I'm...

- Building scalable applications that can grow with your business
- Exploring new ways to improve developer and user experience
- Contributing to open-source projects when I can
- Always learning - recently diving deeper into system design

## 🤝 Let's Work Together

I'm looking for opportunities where I can:
- Make a real impact on products and users
- Work with teams that value both quality and speed
- Contribute to meaningful projects
- Keep learning and growing

**I'm open to:** Full-time roles • Contract work • Interesting projects • Tech conversations
